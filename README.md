QuickCards is a React Native application that allows users to create professional business cards that are written directly onto NFC tags. Whether you're representing a business or showcasing your personal brand, QuickCards simplifies designing and managing business cards, ensuring seamless sharing through NFC technology.

## üöÄ Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and responsive design for a seamless experience
- **Two Types of Business Cards**: Create customized cards for companies or freelancers
- **NFC Integration**: Write business card details directly onto an NFC tag for effortless sharing
- **Enhanced Connectivity**: Include up to 3 links to social media profiles or other contact options, streamlining connections beyond traditional business cards

## üì± The App
QuickCards leverages NFC tags to make sharing business or freelancer information more efficient. The app features two main sections: the first one is the Initialization, which is used to create personalized business cards and the second one allows users to scan NFC tags and retrieve detailed business card information.

### How it works

- **Initialization**:
    - Choose to create a card for a company or as a freelancer
    - Fill in the initialization fields (some mandatory, others optional)
    - Once completed, initialize the card and hold an NFC tag close to write the data
- **Card Display**:
    - On the home screen click on the scanning section button
    - Scan the NFC tag
    - Instantly view business card details presented in an elegant and user-friendly format
